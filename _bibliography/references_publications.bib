abstract = {OBJECTIVES In this study, we explored the effects of chiropractic spinal adjustments on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and early somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. METHODS In this randomized cross-over study, 14 adults with Alzheimer's disease (average age 67 ± 6 years, 2 females:12 males) and 14 adults with Parkinson's disease (average age 62 ± 11 years, 1 female:13 males) participated. The participants underwent chiropractic spinal adjustments and a control (sham) intervention in a randomized order, with a minimum of one week between each intervention. EEG was recorded before and after each intervention, both during rest and stimulation of the right median nerve. The power-spectra was calculated for resting-state EEG, and the amplitude of the N30 peak was assessed for the SEPs. The source localization was performed on the power-spectra of resting-state EEG and the N30 SEP peak. RESULTS Chiropractic spinal adjustment significantly reduced the N30 peak in individuals with Alzheimer's by 15% (p = 0.027). While other outcomes did not reach significance, resting-state EEG showed an increase in absolute power in all frequency bands after chiropractic spinal adjustments in individuals with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The findings revealed a notable enhancement in connectivity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) at the alpha, beta, and theta frequency bands among individuals undergoing chiropractic adjustments. CONCLUSIONS We found that it is feasible to record EEG/SEP in individuals with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, a single session of chiropractic spinal adjustment reduced the somatosensory evoked N30 potential and enhancement in connectivity within the DMN at the alpha, beta, and theta frequency bands in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Future studies may require a larger sample size to estimate the effects of chiropractic spinal adjustment on brain activity. Given the preliminary nature of our findings, caution is warranted when considering the clinical implications. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION The study was registered by the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (registration number ACTRN12618001217291 and 12618001218280).},

abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that a high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) thrust directed at a dysfunctional vertebral segment in people with subclinical spinal pain alters various neurophysiological measures, including somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). We hypothesized that an HVLA thrust applied to a clinician chosen vertebral segment based on clinical indicators of vertebral dysfunction, in short, segment considered as “relevant” would significantly reduce the N30 amplitude compared to an HVLA thrust applied to a predetermined vertebral segment not based on clinical indicators of vertebral dysfunction or segment considered as “non-relevant”. In this double-blinded, active-controlled, parallel-design study, 96 adults with recurrent mild neck pain, ache, or stiffness were randomly allocated to receiving a single thrust directed at either a segment considered as “relevant” or a segment considered as “non-relevant" in their upper cervical spine. SEPs of median nerve stimulation were recorded before and immediately after a single HVLA application delivered using an adjusting instrument (Activator). A linear mixed model was used to assess changes in the N30 amplitude. A significant interaction between the site of thrust delivery and session was found (F1,840 = 9.89, p < 0.002). Pairwise comparisons showed a significant immediate decrease in the N30 complex amplitude after the application of HVLA thrust to a segment considered “relevant” (− 16.76 ± 28.32%, p = 0.005). In contrast, no significant change was observed in the group that received HVLA thrust over a segment considered “non-relevant” (p = 0.757). Cervical HVLA thrust applied to the segment considered as “relevant” altered sensorimotor parameters, while cervical HVLA thrust over the segment considered as “non-relevant” did not. This finding supports the hypothesis that spinal site targeting of HVLA interventions is important when measuring neurophysiological responses. Further studies are needed to explore the potential clinical relevance of these findings.},

ABSTRACT = {Certain blood biomarkers are associated with neural protection and neural plasticity in healthy people and individuals with prior brain injury. To date, no studies have evaluated the effects chiropractic care on serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in people with stroke. This manuscript reports pre-specified, exploratory, secondary outcomes from a previously completed parallel group randomized controlled trial. We evaluated differences between four weeks of chiropractic spinal adjustments combined with the usual physical therapy (chiro + PT) and sham chiropractic with physical therapy (sham + PT) on resting serum BDNF, IGF-II and GDNF in 63 adults with chronic stroke. Blood samples were assessed at baseline, four weeks (post-intervention), and eight weeks (follow-up). Data were analyzed using a linear multivariate mixed effects model. Within both groups there was a significant decrease in the mean log-concentration of BDNF and IGF-II at each follow-up, and significant increase log-concentration of GDNF at eight-weeks&rsquo; follow-up. However, no significant between-group differences in any of the blood biomarkers at each time-point were found. Further research is required to explore which factors influence changes in serum BDNF, IGF-II and GDNF following chiropractic spinal adjustments and physical therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The core intrinsic connectivity networks (core-ICNs), encompassing the default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SN) and central executive network (CEN), have been shown to be dysfunctional in individuals with internalizing disorders (IDs, e.g. major depressive disorder, MDD; generalized anxiety disorder, GAD; social anxiety disorder, SOC). As such, source-localized, closed-loop brain training of electrophysiological signals, also known as standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) neurofeedback (NFB), targeting key cortical nodes within these networks has the potential to reduce symptoms associated with IDs and restore normal core ICN function. We intend to conduct a randomized, double-blind (participant and assessor), sham-controlled, parallel-group (3-arm) trial of sLORETA infraslow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuation neurofeedback (sLORETA ISF-NFB) 3 times per week over 4 weeks in participants (n=60) with IDs. Our primary objectives will be to examine patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and neurophysiological measures to (1) compare the potential effects of sham ISF-NFB to either genuine 1-region ISF-NFB or genuine 2-region ISF-NFB, and (2) assess for potential associations between changes in PRO scores and modifications of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity/connectivity within/between the trained regions of interest (ROIs). As part of an exploratory analysis, we will investigate the effects of additional training sessions and the potential for the potentiation of the effects over time. METHODS We will randomly assign participants who meet the criteria for MDD, GAD, and/or SOC per the MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-5) to one of three groups: (1) 12 sessions of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) ISF-NFB up-training (n=15), (2) 12 sessions of concurrent PCC ISF up-training and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) ISF-NFB down-training (n=15), or (3) 6 sessions of yoked-sham training followed by 6 sessions genuine ISF-NFB (n=30). Transdiagnostic PROs (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS; Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms - Second Version, IDAS-II; Multidimensional Emotional Disorder Inventory, MEDI; Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale - Short Form, IUS-12; Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire, RTQ-10) as well as resting-state neurophysiological measures (full-band EEG and ECG) will be collected from all subjects during two baseline sessions (approximately 1 week apart) then at post 6 sessions, post 12 sessions, and follow-up (1 month later). We will employ Bayesian methods in R and advanced source-localisation software (i.e. exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography; eLORETA) in our analysis. DISCUSSION This protocol will outline the rationale and research methodology for a clinical pilot trial of sLORETA ISF-NFB targeting key nodes within the core-ICNs in a female ID population with the primary aims being to assess its potential efficacy via transdiagnostic PROs and relevant neurophysiological measures.

@article{Niazi2022-9,
abstract = {Objective: We propose a novel cue-based asynchronous brain-computer inter-face(BCI) for neuromodulation via the pairing of endogenous motor cortical activity with the activation of somatosensory pathways. Methods: The proposed BCI detects the intention to move from single-trial EEG signals in real time, but, contrary to classic asynchronous-BCI systems, the detection occurs only during time intervals when the patient is cued to move. This cue-based asynchronous-BCI was compared with two traditional BCI modes (asynchronous-BCI and off-line synchronous-BCI) and a control intervention in chronic stroke patients. The patients performed ankle dorsiflexion movements of the paretic limb in each intervention while their brain signals were recorded. BCI interventions decoded the movement attempt and activated afferent pathways via electrical stimulation. Corticomotor excitability was assessed using motor-evoked potentials in the tibialis-anterior muscle induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation before, immediately after, and 30 min after the intervention. Results: The proposed cue-based asynchronous-BCI had significantly fewer false positives/min and false pos-itives/true positives (%) as compared to the previously developed asynchronous-BCI. Linear-mixed-models showed that motor-evoked potential amplitudes increased following all BCI modes immediately after the intervention compared to the control condition (p <0.05). The proposed cue-based asynchronous-BCI resulted in the largest relative increase in peak-to-peak motor-evoked potential amplitudes(141% AE 33%) among all interventions and sustained it for 30 min (111% AE 33%). Interpretation: These findings prove the high performance of a newly proposed cue-based asynchronous-BCI intervention. In this paradigm, individuals receive precise instructions (cue) to promote engagement, while the timing of brain activity is accurately detected to establish a precise association with the delivery of sensory input for plasticity induction.},

abstract = {Recently it has been acknowledged that the basal ganglia nuclei play a major role in cognitive control; however, the contribution by their network remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in cognitive processing and suggested that its connections to cortical and other associated regions regulate response inhibition during conflict conditions. By contrast, the role of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) as the output nucleus before the thalamic relay has not yet been investigated during cognitive processing. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from externalized deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted bilaterally in the GPi (n = 9 participants with dystonia) and STN (n = 8 participants with Parkinson's disease (PD)) during a primed flanker task. Both dystonia (GPi group) and PD participants (STN group) responded faster to the congruent trials than the incongruent trials. Overall, the dystonic GPi group was significantly faster than the PD STN group. LFPs showed elevated cue-triggered theta (3–7 Hz) power in GPi and STN groups in a similar way. Response-triggered LFP beta power (13–25 Hz) was significantly increased in the GPi group compared to the STN group. Results demonstrate that GPi activity appears to be critical in the cognitive processing of action selection and response during the presence of conflict tasks similar to the STN group.},

abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effects of a single session of chiropractic spinal adjustment on the cortical drive to the lower limb in chronic stroke patients. In a single-blinded, randomized controlled parallel design study, 29 individuals with chronic stroke and motor weakness in a lower limb were randomly divided to receive either chiropractic spinal adjustment or a passive movement control intervention. Before and immediately after the intervention, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of the lower limb with the greatest degree of motor weakness. Differences in the averaged peak-peak MEP amplitude following interventions were calculated using a linear regression model. Chiropractic spinal adjustment elicited significantly larger MEP amplitude (pre = 0.24 ± 0.17 mV, post = 0.39 ± 0.23 mV, absolute difference = +0.15 mV, relative difference = +92%, p < 0.001) compared to the control intervention (pre = 0.15 ± 0.09 mV, post = 0.16 ± 0.09 mV). The results indicate that chiropractic spinal adjustment increases the corticomotor excitability of ankle dorsiflexor muscles in people with chronic stroke. Further research is required to investigate whether chiropractic spinal adjustment increases dorsiflexor muscle strength and walking function in people with stroke.},

@article{Niazi2022-12,
abstract = {Airflow through the left-and-right nostrils is said to be entrained by an endogenous nasal cycle paced by both poles of the hypothalamus. Yogic practices suggest, and scientific evidence demonstrates, that right-nostril breathing is involved with relatively higher sympathetic activity (arousal states), while left-nostril breathing is associated with a relatively more parasympathetic activity (stress alleviating state). The objective of this study was to further explore this laterality by controlling nasal airflow and observing patterns of cortical activity through encephalographic (EEG) recordings. Thirty subjects participated in this crossover study. The experimental session consisted of a resting phase (baseline), then a period of unilateral nostril breathing (UNB) using the dominant nasal airway, followed by UNB using the non-dominant nasal airway. A 64-channel EEG was recorded throughout the whole session. The effects of nostril-dominance, and nostril-lateralization were assessed using the power spectral density of the neural activity. The differences in power-spectra and source localization were calculated between EEG recorded during UNB and baseline for delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Cluster-based permutation tests showed that compared to baseline, EEG spectral power was significantly (1) decreased in all frequency bands for non-dominant nostril UNB, (2) decreased in alpha, beta and gamma bands for dominant nostril UNB, (3) decreased in all bands for left nostril UNB, and (4) decreased in all bands except delta for right nostril UNB. The beta band showed the most widely distributed changes across the scalp. our source localisation results show that breathing with the dominant nostril breathing increases EEG power in the left inferior frontal (alpha band) and left parietal lobule (beta band), whereas non-dominant nostril breathing is related to more diffuse and bilateral effects in posterior areas of the brain.These preliminary findings may stimulate further research in the area, with potential applications to tailored treatment of brain disorders associated with disruption of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.},

abstract = {Introduction: Efficient training methods are required for laparoscopic surgical skills training to reduce the time needed for proficiency. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is widely used to enhance motor skill acquisition and can be used to supplement the training of laparoscopic surgical skill acquisition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) on the performance of a unimanual variant of the laparoscopic peg-transfer task. Methods: Fifteen healthy subjects participated in this randomized, double-blinded crossover study involving an anodal tDCS and a sham tDCS intervention separated by 48 h. On each intervention day, subjects performed a unimanual variant of laparoscopic peg-transfer task in three sessions (baseline, tDCS, post-tDCS). The tDCS session consisted of 10 min of offline tDCS followed by 10 min of online tDCS. The scores based on the task completion time and the number of errors in each session were used as a primary outcome measure. A linear mixed-effects model was used for the analysis. Results: We found that the scores increased over sessions (p < 0.01). However, we found no effects of stimulation (anodal tDCS vs. sham tDCS) and no interaction of stimulation and sessions. Conclusion: This study suggests that irrespective of the type of current stimulation (anodal and sham) over M1, there was an improvement in the performance of the unimanual peg-transfer task, implying that there was motor learning over time. The results would be useful in designing efficient training paradigms and further investigating the effects of tDCS on laparoscopic peg-transfer tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Chiropractic spinal adjustments have been shown to result in short-term increases in muscle strength in chronic stroke patients, however, the effect of longer-term chiropractic spinal adjustments on people with chronic stroke is unknown. This exploratory study assessed whether 4 weeks of chiropractic spinal adjustments, combined with physical therapy (chiro + PT), had a greater impact than sham chiropractic with physical therapy (sham + PT) did on motor function (Fugl Meyer Assessment, FMA) in 63 subacute or chronic stroke patients. Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life and other measures of functional mobility and disability. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks (post-intervention), and 8 weeks (follow-up). Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models or generalized linear mixed models. A post-hoc responder analysis was performed to investigate the clinical significance of findings. At 4 weeks, there was a larger effect of chiro + PT, compared with sham + PT, on the FMA (difference = 6.1, p = 0.04). The responder analysis suggested the improvements in motor function seen following chiropractic spinal adjustments may have been clinically significant. There was also a robust improvement in both groups in most measures from baseline to the 4- and 8-week assessments, but between-group differences were no longer significant at the 8-week assessment. Four weeks of chiro + PT resulted in statistically significant improvements in motor function, compared with sham + PT, in people with subacute or chronic stroke. These improvements appear to be clinically important. Further trials, involving larger group sizes and longer follow-up and intervention periods, are required to corroborate these findings and further investigate the impacts of chiropractic spinal adjustments on motor function in post-stroke survivors.

ABSTRACT = {Stroke impairments often present as cognitive and motor deficits, leading to a decline in quality of life. Recovery strategy and mechanisms, such as neuroplasticity, are important factors, as these can help improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation. The present study investigated chiropractic spinal manipulation (SM) and its effects on resting-state functional connectivity in 24 subacute to chronic stroke patients monitored by electroencephalography (EEG). Functional connectivity of both linear and non-linear coupling was estimated by coherence and phase lag index (PLI), respectively. Non-parametric cluster-based permutation tests were used to assess the statistical significance of the changes in functional connectivity following SM. Results showed a significant increase in functional connectivity from the PLI metric in the alpha band within the default mode network (DMN). The functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and parahippocampal regions increased following SM, t (23) = 10.45, p = 0.005. No significant changes occurred following the sham control procedure. These findings suggest that SM may alter functional connectivity in the brain of stroke patients and highlights the potential of EEG for monitoring neuroplastic changes following SM. Furthermore, the altered connectivity was observed between areas which may be affected by factors such as decreased pain perception, episodic memory, navigation, and space representation in the brain. However, these factors were not directly monitored in this study. Therefore, further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and clinical significance of the observed changes.},

ABSTRACT = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of chiropractic spinal manipulation on the early somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from chronic stroke patients. Methods: Seventeen male patients (53 &plusmn; 12 years old) participated in this randomized cross-over study. The patients received chiropractic spinal manipulation and control intervention, in random order, separated by at least 24 hours. EEG was recorded before and after each intervention during rest and stimulation of the non-paretic median nerve. For resting-state EEG, the delta-alpha ratio, brain-symmetry index, and power-spectra were calculated. For SEPs, the amplitudes and latencies of N20 and N30 peaks were assessed. Source localization was performed on the power-spectra of resting-state EEG and the N30 SEP peak. Results: Following spinal manipulation, the N30 amplitude increased by 39%, which was a significant increase compared to the control intervention (p &lt; 0.01). The latency and changes to the strength of the cortical sources underlying the N30 peak were not significant. The N20 peak, the resting-state power-spectra, delta-alpha ratio, brain-symmetry index, and resting-state source localization showed no significant changes after either intervention. Conclusion: A single session of chiropractic spinal manipulation increased the amplitude of the N30 SEP peak in a group of chronic stroke patients, which may reflect changes to early sensorimotor function. More research is required to investigate the long-term effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation, to better understand what impact it may have on the neurological function of stroke survivors.},

abstract={Brain-computer interfaces have been proposed for stroke rehabilitation. Motor cortical activity derived from the electroencephalography (EEG) can trigger external devices that provide congruent sensory feedback. However, many stroke patients regain residual muscle (EMG: electromyography) control due to spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation; therefore, EEG may not be necessary as a control signal. In this paper, a direct comparison was made between the induction of corticospinal plasticity using either EEG- or EMG-controlled electrical nerve stimulation. Twenty healthy participants participated in two intervention sessions consisting of EEG- and EMG-controlled electrical stimulation. The sessions consisted of 50 pairings between foot dorsiflexion movements (decoded through either EEG or EMG) and electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve. Before, immediately after and 30 minutes after the intervention, 15 motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited in tibialis anterior through transcranial magnetic stimulation. Increased MEPs were observed immediately after (62 ± 26%, 73 ± 27% for EEG- and EMG-triggered electrical stimulation, respectively) and 30 minutes after each of the two interventions (79 ± 26% and 72 ± 27%) compared to the pre-intervention measurement. There was no difference between the interventions. Both EEG- and EMG-controlled electrical stimulation can induce corticospinal plasticity which suggests that stroke patients with residual EMG can use that modality instead of EEG to trigger stimulation.},

ABSTRACT = {Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different preprocessing parameters on the amplitude of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). Methods: Different combinations of two classes of filters (Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)), three cutoff frequency bands (0.5&ndash;1000 Hz, 3&ndash;1000 Hz, and 30&ndash;1000 Hz), and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to preprocess SEPs recorded from 17 healthy volunteers who participated in two sessions of 1000 stimulations of the right median nerve. N30 amplitude was calculated from frontally placed electrode (F3). Results: The epochs classified as artifacts from SEPs filtered with FIR compared to those filtered with IIR were 1% more using automatic and 140% more using semi-automatic methods (both p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in N30 amplitudes between FIR and IIR filtered SEPs. The N30 amplitude was significantly lower for SEPs filtered with 30&ndash;1000 Hz compared to the bandpass frequencies 0.5&ndash;1000 Hz and 3&ndash;1000 Hz. The N30 amplitude was significantly reduced when SEPs were cleaned with ICA compared to the SEPs from which non-brain components were not removed using ICA. Conclusion: This study suggests that the preprocessing of SEPs should be done carefully and the neuroscience community should come to a consensus regarding SEP preprocessing guidelines, as the preprocessing parameters can affect the outcomes that may influence the interpretations of results, replicability, and comparison of different studies.},

ABSTRACT = {Brain&ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs), operated in a cue-based (offline) or self-paced (online) mode, can be used for inducing cortical plasticity for stroke rehabilitation by the pairing of movement-related brain activity with peripheral electrical stimulation. The aim of this study was to compare the difference in cortical plasticity induced by the two BCI modes. Fifteen healthy participants participated in two experimental sessions: cue-based BCI and self-paced BCI. In both sessions, imagined dorsiflexions were extracted from continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) and paired 50 times with the electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve. Before, immediately after, and 30 min after each intervention, the cortical excitability was measured through the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) of tibialis anterior elicited through transcranial magnetic stimulation. Linear mixed regression models showed that the MEP amplitudes increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) from pre- to post- and 30-min post-intervention in terms of both the absolute and relative units, regardless of the intervention type. Compared to pre-interventions, the absolute MEP size increased by 79% in post- and 68% in 30-min post-intervention in the self-paced mode (with a true positive rate of ~75%), and by 37% in post- and 55% in 30-min post-intervention in the cue-based mode. The two modes were significantly different (p = 0.03) at post-intervention (relative units) but were similar at both post timepoints (absolute units). These findings suggest that immediate changes in cortical excitability may have implications for stroke rehabilitation, where it could be used as a priming protocol in conjunction with another intervention; however, the findings need to be validated in studies involving stroke patients.},

abstract={The objectives of the study were to investigate changes in pain perception and neural activity during tonic pain due to altered sensory input from the spine following chiropractic spinal adjustments. Fifteen participants with subclinical pain (recurrent spinal dysfunction such as mild pain, ache or stiffness but with no pain on the day of the experiment) participated in this randomized cross-over study involving a chiropractic spinal adjustment and a sham session, separated by 4.0{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}4.2 days. Before and after each intervention, 61-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded at rest and during 80{\thinspace}seconds of tonic pain evoked by the cold-pressor test (left hand immersed in 2{\thinspace}{\textdegree}C water). Participants rated the pain and unpleasantness to the cold-pressor test on two separate numerical rating scales. To study brain sources, sLORETA was performed on four EEG frequency bands: delta (1--4{\thinspace}Hz), theta (4--8{\thinspace}Hz), alpha (8--12{\thinspace}Hz) and beta (12--32{\thinspace}Hz). The pain scores decreased by 9{\%} after the sham intervention (p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05), whereas the unpleasantness scores decreased by 7{\%} after both interventions (p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05). sLORETA showed decreased brain activity following tonic pain in all frequency bands after the sham intervention, whereas no change in activity was seen after the chiropractic spinal adjustment session. This study showed habituation to pain following the sham intervention, with no habituation occurring following the chiropractic intervention. This suggests that the chiropractic spinal adjustments may alter central processing of pain and unpleasantness.},

ABSTRACT = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can be used to induce neural plasticity in the human nervous system by pairing motor cortical activity with relevant afferent feedback, which can be used in neurorehabilitation. The aim of this study was to identify the optimal type or combination of afferent feedback modalities to increase cortical excitability in a BCI training intervention. In three experimental sessions, 12 healthy participants imagined a dorsiflexion that was decoded by a BCI which activated relevant afferent feedback: (1) electrical nerve stimulation (ES) (peroneal nerve&mdash;innervating tibialis anterior), (2) passive movement (PM) of the ankle joint, or (3) combined electrical stimulation and passive movement (Comb). The cortical excitability was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation determining motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in tibialis anterior before, immediately after and 30 min after the BCI training. Linear mixed regression models were used to assess the changes in MEPs. The three interventions led to a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in MEP amplitudes immediately and 30 min after the training. The effect sizes of Comb paradigm were larger than ES and PM, although, these differences were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). These results indicate that the timing of movement imagery and afferent feedback is the main determinant of induced cortical plasticity whereas the specific type of feedback has a moderate impact. These findings can be important for the translation of such a BCI protocol to the clinical practice where by combining the BCI with the already available equipment cortical plasticity can be effectively induced. The findings in the current study need to be validated in stroke populations.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to construct peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) and peristimulus frequencygram (PSF) using single motor unit recordings to further characterize the previously documented immediate sensorimotor effects of spinal manipulation. Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) via a double cone coil over the tibialis anterior (TA) motor area during weak isometric dorsiflexion of the foot was used on two different days in random order; pre/post spinal manipulation (in eighteen subjects) and pre/post a control (in twelve subjects) condition. TA electromyography (EMG) was recorded with surface and intramuscular fine wire electrodes. Three subjects also received sham double cone coil TMS pre and post a spinal manipulation intervention. From the averaged surface EMG data cortical silent periods (CSP) were constructed and analysed. Twenty-one single motor units were identified for the spinal manipulation intervention and twelve single motor units were identified for the control intervention. Following spinal manipulations there was a shortening of the silent period and an increase in the single unit I-wave amplitude. No changes were observed following the control condition. The results provide evidence that spinal manipulation reduces the TMS-induced cortical silent period and increases low threshold motoneurone excitability in the lower limb muscle. These finding may have important clinical implications as they provide support that spinal manipulation can be used to strengthen muscles. This could be followed up on populations that have reduced muscle strength, such as stroke victims.}

To use the BCI efficiently, the system must be technically tuned, and the user must learn to operate it. In this study, we investigated if the user could be trained to improve the performance of online detection of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) associated with fast and slow movements. Seven healthy subjects participated in nine experiments over eight weeks while the ability of the online system to detect the movements was accessed. The movements were detected using template matching. No training effect was observed on the performance or MRCP morphology over the eight weeks. The system correctly detected ∼80% of the movements with ∼1.5 false positive detections/min. The findings suggest that the detection of MRCPs is stable from the first session and that several training sessions are not needed to obtain control of the BCI; this may have implication for the applicability of BCIs for movement detection.}

abstract = { Closed-loop BCIs have recently been proposed for neurorehabilitation. This concept can be extended to complex motor tasks by decoding the type of the attempted movement in a multi-class BCI. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect movements from real-time EEG and classify two movement types associated with the movement kinetics. EEG traces corresponding to executed and imagined movements of 12 healthy subjects and attempted movements of six stroke patients were detected using a template matching technique. Signal segments were characterized by six features and classified with a support vector machine. The system correctly detected and classified 57 ± 3\%, 53 ± 6\%, and 47 ± 7\% of the executed, imaginary, and attempted movements, respectively. The performance of the detector was ~80\%, and the classifier performance was in the range 63–70\%. There were on average 1.6–1.9 false positive detections per minute. The results indicate that it is possible to detect executed, imaginary, and attempted movements in real time and classify movement kinetics. With improved performance, this could potentially be combined with functional electrical stimulation to promote neurorehabilitation by providing meaningful afferent feedback according to the attempted task. }

abstract = {Background
Psychometric, anatomical and functional brain studies suggest that individuals differ in the way that they perceive and analyze information and strategically control and execute movements. Inter-individual differences are also observed in neural correlates of specific and general cognitive ability. As a result, some individuals perceive and adapt to environmental conditions and perform motor activities better than others. The aim of this study was to identify a common factor that predicts adaptation of a reaching movement to a visual perturbation and suppression of movement-related brain activity (mu rhythms).
Results
Twenty-eight participants participated in two different experiments designed to evaluate visuomotor adaptation and mu suppression ability. Performance intelligence quotient (IQ) was assessed using the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Performance IQ predicted adaptation index of visuomotor performance (r=0.43, p=0.02) and suppression of mu rhythms (r=−0.59; p<0.001). Participants with high performance IQ were faster at adapting to a visuomotor perturbation and better at suppressing mu activity than participants with low performance IQ.
Conclusions
We found a possible link between performance IQ and mu suppression, and performance IQ and the initial rate of adaptation. Individuals with high performance IQ were better in suppressing mu rhythms and were quicker at associating motor command and required movement than individuals with low performance IQ.}
